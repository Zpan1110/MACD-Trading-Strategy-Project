# MACD Crossover Trading Strategy with Candidate Pool Based on Volatility
## Abstract
This project examines the effectiveness of a refined version of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) strategy as a tool for technical analysis in financial markets. By applying the MACD crossover strategy to a dataset derived from Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stocks, refined through heuristic filtering for volatility, we aim to capture enhanced returns while mitigating variance over time. The study covers different time frames within three decades of data, from 1992 to 2022, and utilizes the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 as benchmarks, with Treasury Bills as the risk-free rate. Through a rigorous methodology that assesses various financial metrics including cumulative returns, Sharpe ratios, and Fama French betas, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of our strategyâ€™s performance across different market conditions and risk profiles.
